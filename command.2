The concept of a hard link is the most basic we will discuss today. 
Every file on the Linux filesystem starts with a single hard link.
The link is between the filename and the actual data stored on the filesystem. 
Creating an additional hard link to a file means a few different things. Let's discuss these.

First, you create a new filename pointing to the exact same data as the old filename.
This means that the two filenames, though different, point to identical data. 
For example, if I create file /home/tcarrigan/demo/link_test and write hello world in the file,
I have a single hard link between the file name link_test and the file content hello world.
